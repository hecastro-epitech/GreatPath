  "introduction": "Hey, wake up! You look a bit lost. Do you remember why we are here? I am Aurora, your loyal sidekick. We met each other a couple years ago when we were on a mission together. The mission was given by some sourcerers, they wanted us to stop a huge threat to the world.",
  "player": "Do you want to know about you? You are a true challenger among humans. People tend to welcome you with open arms, while wanting to fight along your side in battle. You are trained well enough to fight without any fear or favour, but also to look for ways forward that you cannot control.",
  "boss": "I will describe our enemy for you. He is called Warwick, the Bloodthirster. People say he can smell fear and blood from miles and he doesn't think twice before killing. No one knows where he came from, but since he showed up the land is not safe."
